#8E1.Which of the following is a requirement of the simple Metropolis algorithm? 
#(1) The parameters must be discrete. 
#(2) The likelihood function must be Gaussian. 
#(3) The proposal distribution must be symmetric.
## Answer:(3)

#8E2.Gibbs sampling is more efficient than the Metropolis algorithm. How does it achieve this extra efficiency? Are there any limitations to the Gibbs sampling strategy?
## Answer: using adaptive proposal,in which distribution of proposed parameter values adjusts itself intelligently,depending upon the parameter values at the moment. The adaptive proposals depends upon using particular combinations of prior distributions and likelihoods known as conjugate pairs.(not clear about the detail)
